            <h3 class="descriptor"> Challenges </h3>
            <p>The main challenges I faced where mostly from the limited amount of 
                documentation regarding supabse for Kotlin. The implementation is provided 
                by the community on a github repo. Trying to figure out how to communicate 
                with the database was a lot of trial and error, costing more time than 
                actually implementing the feature.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another problem was the like and follow functionality which required 
                us to create two new tables for our database. Then, there was figuring 
                out how to actually use these tables was another challenge. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="descriptor"> Contribution </h3>
            <p>
                I was mostly tasked with authentication and anything CRUD related with 
                users. I have done a lot of work on the database, like table creation 
                and initializing in the project. I have also made the UI for the profile 
                page and worked on most of the search functionality. Though mostly, 
                Hetian and I shared work on the same features. We both communicated our 
                contributions and planned ahead what needs to be done and who is doing it.
            </p>
            <h3 class="descriptor"> Closing Words </h3>
            <p>
                In the end, I am extremely proud of what we have created. For the most 
                part, “dwitter” is a functioning social media app with a personality of 
                its own. Some changes have been made to the original design, mainly the 
                color scheme and some added buttons for more interactivity. When it 
                comes to the main functions of the app, I would say we implemented more 
                than was originally planned. However, if there was more time, I would have 
                liked to add a view for other users, checking out their profile and posts.
