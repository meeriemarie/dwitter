            <h3 class="descriptor"> Challenges </h3>
            <p>The main challenges I faced where mostly from the limited amount of 
                documentation regarding supabse for Kotlin. The implementation is provided 
                by the community on a github repo. Trying to figure out how to communicate 
                with the database was a lot of trial and error, costing more time than 
                actually implementing the feature.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another problem was the like and follow functionality which required 
                us to create two new tables for our database. Then, there was figuring 
                out how to actually use these tables was another challenge. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="descriptor"> Contribution </h3>
            <p>
                I was mostly tasked with authentication and anything CRUD related with 
                users. I have done a lot of work on the database, like table creation 
                and initializing in the project. I have also made the UI for the profile 
                page and worked on most of the search functionality. Though mostly, 
                Hetian and I shared work on the same features. We both communicated our 
                contributions and planned ahead what needs to be done and who is doing it.
            </p>
            <h3 class="descriptor"> Closing Words </h3>
            <p>
                In the end, I am extremely proud of what we have created. For the most 
                part, “dwitter” is a functioning social media app with a personality of 
                its own. Some changes have been made to the original design, mainly the 
                color scheme and some added buttons for more interactivity. When it 
                comes to the main functions of the app, I would say we implemented more 
                than was originally planned. However, if there was more time, I would have 
                liked to add a view for other users, checking out their profile and posts.
            </p>

            <h3 class="descriptor"> Challenges </h3>
            <p>One of the main challenges I faced was app navigation, particularly reworking
                and implementing nested navigation effectively. Refactoring and cleaning up 
                the code to improve readability and maintainability was another significant 
                hurdle. Additionally, I struggled with finding best practices for structuring 
                the project, reducing code redundancies, and ensuring proper file separation. 
                In the end, I gave up trying to figure out the best practice due to time 
                constraints and the project deadline.  
            </p>
            <p>Another challenge was making the UI fully responsive. There are still some 
                inconsistencies and bugs that affect the overall user experience, more than I 
                would like. Addressing these issues remains an ongoing effort.
            </p>
            <h3 class="descriptor"> Contribution </h3>
            <p> I handled everything related to image upload and CRUD operations for posts.
                I also worked on refactoring by separating files, renaming them to fit the 
                class structure, and organizing/cleaning up API calls in the ViewModel. 
                Additionally, I styled the UI using Material Design 3. Marie and I shared 
                responsibilities such as bug fixing, database design, and navigation.
            </p>
            <h3 class="descriptor"> Closing Words </h3>
            <p>I am very grateful for Marie’s contribution—this app wouldn’t have been possible
                without her work, especially on authentication, which was particularly challenging 
                to handle. I’m happy with our app, "Dwitter"—it’s functional and covers the basics 
                of a social media platform. Throughout this experience, I’ve learned so much about 
                project structure, navigation, and state management, which will definitely help in 
                future projects.
            </p>
            <p>On another very far fetched note: We plan to publish the app as a bulletin board-style
                Twitter clone for BCC students, allowing them to share whatever they want—unfiltered.
                We said this jokingly… unless we aren’t.
